# football
This is an Elm app to manage the playtime of a football team

## DONE
### When two players have played the same amount of time, choose the one who has kept less as a keeper
### Play only when the players present are at least the minimum amount, keep the "Play!" button disabled otherwise

## TODO
### Never select a keeper two times after each other
### Use fuzzy tests to make sure the substitution algorithm works fine
### Make UI nicer with bulma css and/or style-elements
### Implement local storage to keep track of the team
### Implement the settings page
### Use elm-lang Navigation and refactor the model and remove state, add Page to keep track of location
