# football
This is an Elm app to manage the playtime of a football team

## TODO
- [x] When two players have played the same amount of time, choose the one who has kept less as a keeper
- [x] Play only when the players present are at least the minimum amount, keep the "Play!" button disabled otherwise
- [x] Use fuzzy tests to make sure the substitution algorithm works fine
- [x] Implement local storage to keep track of the team
- [ ] Never select a keeper two times after each other
- [ ] Make UI nicer with bulma css and/or style-elements
- [ ] Implement the settings page
- [ ] Use elm-lang Navigation and refactor the model and remove state
